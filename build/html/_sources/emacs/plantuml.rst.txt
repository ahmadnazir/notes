PlantUML
========

Spacemacs comes with a `plantuml` layer which has a major mode for modifying such files.

Files with extension `.pum` are recognized.

Once installed, set the output type to `png` (`plantuml-set-output-type`)
Generate a preview: `plantuml-preview`

Local rendering
---------------

Download the jar: `plantuml-download-jar`.

A few more variables that might need customizing:

- `plantuml-default-exec-mode` : `jar` (instead of `server`)
- `plantuml-jar-path` : path where you download the jar. If you want to manually download the jar, checkout: https://plantuml.com/download

Not the preview will be generated locally.
